### Challenges Faced and Solutions 🚧

#### Challenge 1: Environment Variable Configuration 🔐

**Problem**: Initially struggled with proper environment variable setup between development and production environments.

**Solution**:

- Created separate `.env` files for server and client
- Used `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix for client-side variables
- Implemented proper validation for missing credentials
- Added fallback handling for development scenarios


#### Challenge 2: Storage Policy Configuration 📋

**Problem**: Videos weren't accessible due to incorrect storage policies.

**Solution**:

- Reviewed Supabase documentation for policy syntax 
- Created separate policies for upload and view operations
- Tested policies with different user authentication states
- Implemented proper role-based access control


#### Challenge 3: File Upload Flow 📤

**Problem**: Direct upload implementation required significant changes to existing upload logic.

**Solution**:

- Refactored upload service to handle direct Supabase uploads
- Updated progress tracking for client-side uploads
- Implemented proper error handling for upload failures
- Maintained backward compatibility during transition


#### Challenge 4: URL Management 🔗

**Problem**: Existing video URLs needed to be updated to use Supabase storage URLs.

**Solution**:

- Created URL transformation utility functions
- Updated database schema to store both local and cloud paths
- Implemented gradual migration strategy
- Added fallback logic for mixed storage scenarios


#### Challenge 5: Migration Script Complexity 🔄

**Problem**: Migrating existing videos while maintaining service availability.

**Solution**:

- Developed incremental migration approach
- Added progress tracking and error logging
- Implemented rollback capabilities
- Tested migration on subset of data first


### Key Takeaways 🎯
